NOTES

- could find stuff here: https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-19-a-cheatsheet-to-json-handling.html

## TODOS

- check if todo exists when trying to delete. if it does not exist, error 404.
  - DONE
- maybe always reponse with JSON that has some fields on error case. (e.g.
  status 400, { message: "invalid input" }
